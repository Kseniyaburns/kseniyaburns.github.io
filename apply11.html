		How to Build Good Credit
	</header>
	
	<main>
		<p>Without good credit it is hard to get a loan, get a home loan, or buy a car.</p>
		
		<p>To have a FICO score, for example, you need at least one account thatâ€™s been open six months or longer. You also need at least one creditor reporting your activity to the credit bureaus in the last six months.</p>
		
		<p>There are at least three ways to build good credit.
			<ul>
				<li>Apply for a secured credit card.</li>
				<li>Apply for a credit builder loan.</li>
				<li>Get a co-signer</li>
			</ul>
